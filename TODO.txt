Proposed / Planned Features:

- PowerShell ISE integration - potentially...
	- Wizard-based script creation
	- Hhelp system integration
- Handling of UI when running in Session 0. Either through...
	- Client / Server architecture using Named Pipes. Main script runs in Session 0 and spawns UI / user specific tasks to user session
	- Process elevation in user session using token impersonation (same method as ServiceUI.exe)
- Detection of RDP users, basically get the same results as quser.exe but using Win32 APIs so it works on Windows flavors where quser.exe doesn't exist
- Detect toolkit log file location from XML for deploy-application.exe
- Add Debug param to help section in deploy-application.ps1 script

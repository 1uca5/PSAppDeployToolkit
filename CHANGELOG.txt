	Revert change that prevented AllowDefer and CloseAppsCountdown from working together

Version 3.0.9 11/29/2013
	Note	We recently attempted to add a killer new feature and release 3.1.0. We thought we had nailed it but ended up hitting problems once we went into production environments.
			Worse still, we ended up causing a bunch of problems in 3.0.8 trying to reverse out all of these changes. 
			We've prided ourselves on getting to be a really stable toolkit that works well in an enterprise environment. 
			So we're very sorry for the shoddiness of 3.0.8 and have taken a number of steps (a QA process and test scripts) to ensure we don't have these issues going forward.
	Added handling of X86 environment variables so they are never empty
	Added prevention of AllowDefer and CloseAppsCountdown at the same time
	Added x86 support to Register-DLL and Unregister-DLL (if DLL is dropped in SysWOW64)
	Fixed Register-DLL and Unregister-DLL when using paths with spaces
	Fixed sporadic log file corruption that were introduced in v3.0.8
	Fixed CloseAppsCountdown that got broken in v3.0.8
	Fixed DeployMode handling that got broken in v3.0.8

Version 3.0.8 11/26/2013
	Show-InstallationWelcome now supports exact process matching by specifying .exe after process name.
	Added Swedish translation & improved German translation.
	Changed Write-Log function to use StreamWriter, which is faster
	Modified application name on block app execution prompt (cosmetic).

	Fixed parameter encapsulation in asynchronous prompts and scheduled task creation.
	Fixed extension script not dot-sourcing from UNC path.

Version 3.0.7 10/24/2013
	Fixed issue where Session 0 was not detected correctly, resulting in issues when attempting to display a UI when none was allowed
	Fixed Installation Prompt and Installation Restart Prompt appearing when deploy mode was non-interactive or silent
	Fixed issue where defer prompt is displayed after force closing multiple applications
	Fixed issue executing blocked app execution dialog from UNC path (executed instead from local temporary directory)

	Fixed error failing to locate schtasks.exe 
	Fixed "Restart Now" button text not using text from config file
	Corrected the window properties of the countdown-no-hide phase of restart prompt to be topmost.

Version 3.0.6 10/10/2013
	Added PersistPrompt parameter to Show-InstallationWelcome and Show-InstallationPrompt. Prompt window is persistently returned to center screen after interval specified in config file (default 10 seconds). For Show-InstallationWelcome, this only takes effect if deferral is not available to user. The user will have no option but to respond to the prompt - resistance is futile!
	Added example advanced Office 2010 deployment script
	Asynchronous actions now write to the same log file as synchronous actions
	Changed Defer Exit Code default to 5000. In CM07, deployments with deferrals should be set on a recurring schedule (ie, every 4 hours, not just As Soon As Possible). In CM12, the Application Model evaluates once a day by default (can be changed in Client Settings)
	Fixed Get-ScheduledTask not running on non-English system
	Fixed error deleting deferral history in registry on successful installation.
	Fixed non default Defer Exit Code from displaying error - should display a warning

Version 3.0.2 08/29/2013

	Added CheckDiskSpace and RequiredDiskSpace parameters to Show-InstallationWelcome
		If CheckDiskSpace parameter is used, disk space will be evaluated before showing the Welcome screen. If disk space requirements are not met, an error message will be displayed and a Fast Retry (1618) exit code generated. The disk space requirements are calculated automatically based on the size of the source files or by specifying the required space in MB using the RequiredDiskSpace parameter. 
	Added Get-FreeDiskSpace function (returns value in MB)

Version 4.0 [xx/xx/2014]
	When running as SYSTEM, the toolkit will automatically break out of Session 0 to the logged on user context in order to provide user interaction. If a task sequence is running, no user is logged on, or non-interactive deployment mode has been specified then the toolkit will run silently.

Version 3.1.6 [07/08/2014]
	Further optimizations/best practice changes to Execute-Process to improve parameter validation, object and exception handling. (Thanks to mmashwani)
	Added Get-MsiExitCodeMessage - used by Execute-MSI (also available to Execute-Process) to get MSI exit code description if not handled by default. (Thanks to mmashwani)
	Added Test-MsiExecMutex - used by Execute-MSI (also available to Execute-Process) to check if an in-progress MSI installation is preventing an MSI from installing and waits up to 10 minutes - this reduces instances of MSI error code 1618. (Thanks to mmashwani)
	Improved exception handling in Write-Log
	Added error handling when the toolkit fails to dot source, i.e. no more "The term 'Write-Log' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet"
	The install title format on asynchronous UI elements will now match that on the main UI elements.

Version 3.1.5 [01/08/2014]
	Added Send-Keys function to send a sequence of keys to an application window (Thanks to mmashwani)
	Added 3 optimization/stability improvements to Execute-Process following MS best practice (Thanks to mmashwani)
	Fixed issue where Execute-MSI did not use value from XML file for uninstall but instead ran all uninstalls silently by default
	Fixed error on 1641 exit code (should be a success like 3010)
	Fixed issue with error handling in Invoke-SCCMTask
	Fixed issue with deferral dates where the letter Z is in the month (non-English languages)

Version 3.0.9 11/29/2013
	Note	We recently attempted to add a killer new feature and release 3.1.0. We thought we had nailed it but ended up hitting problems once we went into production environments.
			Worse still, we ended up causing a bunch of problems in 3.0.8 trying to reverse out all of these changes. 
			We've prided ourselves on getting to be a really stable toolkit that works well in an enterprise environment. 
			So we're very sorry for the shoddiness of 3.0.8 and have taken a number of steps (a QA process and test scripts) to ensure we don't have these issues going forward.

	Added example advanced Office 2010 deployment script
	Asynchronous actions now write to the same log file as synchronous actions
	Changed Defer Exit Code default to 5000. In CM07, deployments with deferrals should be set on a recurring schedule (ie, every 4 hours, not just As Soon As Possible). In CM12, the Application Model evaluates once a day by default (can be changed in Client Settings)
	Fixed Get-ScheduledTask not running on non-English system
